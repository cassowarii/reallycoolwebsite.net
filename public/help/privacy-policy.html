            <p>This website does not track you or use any type of cookies,
            other than the necessary session cookies to keep track of which
            account you are currently logged into. In fact, the website does
            not even use any Javascript, currently.</p>

            <p>However, this is a website where you can upload user-generated
            content, so please be careful with what you upload.
            I recommend not uploading personally-identifying information.</p>

            <p>An email address is optional at the moment, but will be necessary
            to reset your password (once I implement this feature.)</p>

            <p>Also, as the administrator of the website, I can view anything
            you upload &mdash; even if I someday add privacy settings, anything
            you post is always viewable by me, so please do not post sensitive
            information. I do not want to read it.</p>

            <p>Lastly, this website does include Youtube embeds, which in
            accordance with Google policy will try to track you when they
            load on the page. You can disable these in user settings, to replace
            them with static images linking to the Youtube page.</p>

            <p>If you are under the age of 13, due to various laws and regulations,
            it is prohibited to sign up for this website.</p>

            <p>That's all, thanks. Be careful, it's a scary internet out there
            these days. I wish you the best of luck in navigating it.</p>
