                RSS: Look, just read this page
            </h1>

            <p>Hi, this is a page about how to subscribe to reallycoolwebsite.net
            feeds via RSS: the hottest technology of 15 years ago.</p>

            <p>Fortunately, this technology was built to last, so it still works
            just as well now as it did back then.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>In order to subscribe, you'll need a <b>feed reader</b>.
            There are about
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_feed_aggregators">a million of these</a>,
            so feel free to find one that works for you. I like the free version of
            <a href="https://www.inoreader.com/">Inoreader</a> quite a bit &mdash;
            they offer a paid version with extra features, but the free version is
            all you need to subscribe to up to 150 feeds, and they have a nice mobile
            app and web interface too.</p>

            <p>It sounds like Chrome
            <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/undead-again-google-brings-back-rss/">
            might be getting a built-in RSS reader soon</a> too, so maybe if you're reading
            this in the future (and using Chrome) you'll be able to use that.</p>

            <p>Once you've got your feed reader app installed, you can add a feed to it.
            RSS feeds are represented by URLs, so there will be a box to type the feed
            address into.</p>

            <p>To subscribe to someone's feed from reallycoolwebsite.net, enter the URL
            <tt>https://reallycoolwebsite.net/~<span style="color:red">username</span>/rss</tt>
            into your reader (replacing &lsquo;username&rsquo; with the username of the
            person you want to subscribe to.) You can find this URL on their user page by
            right-clicking on &lsquo;Subscribe via RSS&rsquo; and selecting &lsquo;Copy link&rsquo;.</p>

            <p>And it's literally as simple as that. Now, you will be able to receive their posts
            in your reader app, and you can use the app to configure notifications, etc.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>By the way, here's a secret tip: Did you know you can subscribe to YouTube channels
            via RSS too? It's
            <a href="https://danielmiessler.com/blog/rss-feed-youtube-channel/">true</a>!
            They don't publicize it because they would prefer you didn't, but if there are
            YouTube channels you want to be sure you see all the videos from, try subscribing
            to them via RSS!</p>

            <p>Actually, a surprising amount of stuff on the internet supports RSS. You can follow blogs, podcasts,
            <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/320264/how-to-get-an-rss-feed-for-any-subreddit/">subreddits</a> (?!),
            and more using this ancient technology that we apparently all forgot about somehow.</p>

            <p>Anyway, have a good time out there, and happy browsing!</p>
